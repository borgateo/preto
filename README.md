# Preto

(Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈpɾetu], Black)

Dark theme 🖤
Inspired by Notion and Google Fonts dark theme, with a hint of red.

## Details

* Font settings:
  * headings use `Merriweather`
  * paragraphs use `Montserrat`
  * the font size is 15px
  * only heading 1 has a line underneath it
  * links, toc, checked checkboxes and inline code are color red (#DA605C)  

All the rest derives from the default github theme.
